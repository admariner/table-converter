# Table converter

## What is table converter?

It's a tool for web producers to easily create HTML tables from spreadsheets. Table converter allows users to easily preview their table.

## Instructions

Note - Table converter is still in development, and some features are still not working correctly.

- Copy and paste a spreadsheet into the Input box
- Choose your options, including whether the table is sortable, and if so, by which column
- When the preview looks good, copy and paste the code into your blog or CMS
